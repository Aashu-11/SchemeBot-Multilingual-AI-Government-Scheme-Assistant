Rural youth who are poor

The target group for DDU-GKY are poor rural youth in the age group 15-35. However, the upper age limit for women candidates, and candidates belonging to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), Transgender and other Special Groups like rehabilitated bonded labour, victims of trafficking, manual scavengers, trans-genders, HIV positive persons, etc shall be 45 years.

The poor will be identified by a process called Participatory Identification of Poor (PIP) which is an important component of the NRLM strategy. Till the time, the poor are identified through the use of PIP, apart from the existing list of Below Poverty Line (BPL) households, youth from MGNREGA worker households with at least 15 days of work in the previous financial year by any of its family members, or youth from a household with RSBY card wherein the details of youth is mentioned in the card or youth from households who have been issued, Antyodaya Anna
Yojana / BPL PDS cards, or youth from a household where a family member is a member of SHG under NRLM, or youth from a household covered under auto inclusion parameters as per SECC, 2011 (when notified), shall also be eligible to avail the skilling program even if such youth are not in the BPL list. It is expected that they will be identified during the PIP.

Focus on SC/ST, minorities and women

At the national level, 50% of the funds would be earmarked for SCs and STs with the proportion between SCs and STs being decided from time to time by the MoRD. A further 15% of the funds would be set apart for beneficiaries from among minority groups. States should also ensure that at least 3% of beneficiaries are from among persons with disabilities. One-third of the persons covered should be women. This earmarking is only the minimum. However, targets from SC and ST can be interchanged if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of
the category and it is certified as such by the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA). 

In the case of people with disabilities, separate projects have to be submitted. These projects will have separate training centers and the unit costs will be different from those mentioned in these guidelines. 

Special groups 

Though there are no separate targets for special groups such as PWD, victims of trafficking, manual scavengers, trans-gender, rehabilitated bonded labor, and other vulnerable groups, States have to develop strategies that address issues of access of special groups who usually get left out. The nature of affirmative action that is required to overcome their challenges and barriers to participation need to be incorporated into the skill action plan proposed by the State. In the case of those with hearing and speech impairment, locomotor and visual impairment it will also be necessary to sensitize prospective employers to ensure they get job placements.

36,Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/day-nrlm,Employment,Loan,"Details
Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is the flagship program of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions for the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. 

NRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.

The Mission
""To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.""

The Core Values
Inclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes
Transparency and accountability of all processes and institutions
Ownership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages – planning, implementation, and, monitoring
Community self-reliance and self-dependence

NRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables - 
(a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, 
(b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery, 
(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and 
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. 

As NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios.","Benefits
Key benefits of the Scheme include:
One member (preferably a woman) from each rural poor household would be brought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network. Women SHG groups would have bank-linkage arrangements.
SHGs would be federated at the village level and higher levels to provide space, voice and resources and to reduce dependence on external agencies.
The Mission consists of four components, viz., (i) social mobilization, community institution, and capacity building; (ii) financial inclusion; (iii) livelihood promotion; and (iv) convergence.
The participatory social assessment would be organized to identify and rank all households according to vulnerability. The ranking would be with reference to the poorest of the poor, single woman and woman-headed households, disabled, landless, and migrant labor and they would receive special focus.
Training and capacity building of the poor, particularly in relation to managing the institutions, livelihoods, credit absorption, and creditworthiness.
The Mission also supports the development of skills for rural youth and their placement, training, and self-employment through rural self-employment institutes (RSETIs), innovations, infrastructure creation, and market support.
Provision of Revolving Fund as support to SHGs to strengthen their institutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit history.

Provision of Interest Subvention on loans availed by SHGs to cover the difference between the lending rate of the banks and 7%.

The scheme has the following two components
Sharing of 25% of prescribed stipend subject to a maximum of Rs. 1500/- per month per apprentice with the employers.
 Sharing of basic training costs up to a maximum of Rs. 7,500 per apprentice.

Key Features

These courses will be given the status of optional trades & the relevant practical content for on-the-job training shall be added by the respective course approving authority.
Ease of Administering through technology - A specially designed online portal “www.apprenticeshipindia.org” shall be used for administering the entire implementation of the Apprenticeship Training online. It shall facilitate the requirements of all key stakeholders such as Candidates, Industry, DGT, RDSDEs, NSDC, SAA, SSDMs and BTPs
Involvement of States/UTs - As per the Apprentices Act, monitoring of apprenticeship training in State Public Sector Undertakings and Private Sector Establishments is done by the respective State Governments. States have a very important role in implementing the programme as most of the smaller Industries and MSMEs come under the State jurisdiction. Hence sensitizing the states & State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) & also officers up to the District level, on the intent of the reforms becomes critical & a matter of priority. The District Skilling Committees being promoted by both the Central and State governments will be mandated to identify apprenticeship opportunities in their district and ensure appropriate utilisation of same.
Promoter and Facilitators/Third Party Aggregators (TPA) - Since this scheme involves multiple stakeholders, the role of facilitators or Third Party Aggregators (TPAs) becomes important for mobilizing the apprentices, mapping their preferences with the demand from the establishments for apprenticeship opportunities posted on the portal, and helping the establishment in identifying Basic Training Providers. TPAs are engaged as per the guidelines issued by MSDE for their selection.

The National Scheme of Incentive to Girls for Secondary Education promotes the girl child's enrolment of 14-18 years age group at secondary stage, who passes class 8th and subsequently drops out for various socio-economic reasons. The proposed scheme is further intended to retain such girl children up to class 12th. In the year 2004-05, the dropout rate of girls from classes 1st to 8th was about 50.8%. For classes 1st to 10th the dropout rate of girls was about 64% in the same year. Hence, only 36% of the country's girl students could be retained up to class 10th. This is the combined result of several socio-economic factors, but a major contributor is no doubt the inability of the parents to afford the cost of education of the girl child.","Benefits

95,National Scheme Of Welfare Of Fishermen,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/nswf,Financial Assistance,Fisheries,"Details
The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen is a centrally sponsored scheme that provides financial assistance to fishermen. They can use these for constructing houses and community halls for both recreation and work purposes. Further, through the amount availed under this scheme, fishermen can install tube wells.

Objectives-

Provide fishermen with basic amenities such as housing, community halls, tube well for drinking water.
Ensure Financial And Social Securities Of Fishermen And Their Families.
Upgrade The Standard Of Living Of Fishermen.
Educate And Train Fishermen In Advanced Technical Technologies So That They Can Learn Scientific Ways Of Fishing.","Benefits
Here are the features and benefits that this government scheme for fishermen offers -

Housing Facility
The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen offers fishermen facilities for constructing houses. There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed ₹75,000.

Construction of Common Facility
This government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within ₹2 lakh.  Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.

Assurance of Clean Drinking Water
This scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.

Insurance Facility
(For Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen)- This scheme provides fisherfolk or licensed or identified or registered with the States or Union Territory ₹50,000 in case of death or permanent total disability. Also, this scheme provides ₹25,000 for partial permanent disability.

Here, the insurance cover will continue for 12 months, and FISHCOPFED would take out a policy. Also, under this scheme, the affected fishermen will have to pay an annual premium worth ₹15 (per head). Here, the Central Government will pay 50%, and the State Government will pay the remaining 50% subsidy as grants-in-aid. In the case of Union Territories, the Central Government will bear a 100% premium.

On the other hand, those States/UT’s, which subscribed to this Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen through FISHCOPFED, will get a Central share of assistance (100% premium for Union Territories) directly through FISHCOPFED and not through States/UT’s.

Saving cum relief
The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen further offers a savings cum relief scheme. This scheme component collects ₹75 from marine fishermen for 8 months in a year. Total ₹600 needs to be collected to match an equal amount worth ₹600 provided by the State and Central Government to segregate on a 50:50 basis. If any fishermen fail to make payment, the authorities will refund the paid amount with interest at the end of the 4th month. Also, the ‘lean months’ provisions vary from a coastal area or marine area, which FISHCOPFED decides entirely.

Now that individuals know about this government scheme for fishermen, i.e. the National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen, they avail funds and construct houses of their own.","- Applicant must be living in a coastal area.

The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).

Criteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion - 
1. Households without shelter
2. Destitute/ living on alms
3. Manual scavengers
4. Primitive Tribal Groups
5. Legally released bonded laborer

Prioritisation within the Universe

i.  There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. 
ii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. 
iii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.

Within the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of ""compulsory inclusion"", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. 

The scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:
i. Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59
ii. Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59
iii. Households with no literate adult above 25 years
iv. Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member
v. Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor

Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.

Note: To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.

Earmarking of Targets - 

For SC/ST:
60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.

For Minorities:
Further, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.

For PwDs:
Accordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.

Tie Breaker
In case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:

i. Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.
ii. Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).
iii. Households with a single girl child.
iv. Beneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as Forest Rights Act.
v. Transgender persons.","The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana Gramin (PMAY-G) aims to construct 2.72 crore minimum 25 sq m houses for rural beneficiaries, with financial assistance of up to ₹ 1,30,000 per unit for hilly areas, difficult areas, and IAP districts, and beneficiaries identified using the Socio-Economic and Caste Census.

PMJDY aims at covering every household with a basic Bank Account and a RuPay Debit Card. It can have an inbuilt insurance cover worth ₹100,000. Moreover, it also includes an overdraft facility of up to ₹5,000. Furthermore, the mission of PM Jan Dhan Yojana also includes Direct Benefit Transfer under the Indian Government schemes.

138,Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh / Direct Benefits Transfer For LPG,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pahal-dbtl,Cylinder,LPG,"Details
PAHAL (DBTL) has been introduced to curb the diversion of subsidized LPG. Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.

Before PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market. 

To infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.

PAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using ""Form 5"" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC’s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.

The DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database. 

Such a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further. To confirm this they can either contact their LPG distributor or visit www.mylpg.in and access the individual OMC’s portals. Such consumers will start getting the LPG subsidy directly into their bank account as soon as the scheme is launched in their district. 

Those consumers who didn’t join the scheme earlier but have their Aadhaar number with them can join the scheme and become CTC by getting the same seeded with their LPG distributor as well as with their banks. For those who are not yet enrolled with UIDAI and don’t have an Aadhaar number can also join the scheme and become CTC by getting their bank details seeded into the LPG database. 

Objectives - 
The following are the key objectives of the scheme - 
a) Remove incentive for diversion. 
b) Protect entitlement and ensure subsidy to the consumer. 
c) Improve the availability/delivery of LPG cylinders for genuine users 
d) Weed out fake/duplicate connections
